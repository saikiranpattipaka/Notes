## Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

### üìå Overview
- Amazon S3 is an **object storage service** that offers **scalability**, **high availability**, **durability**, and **security**.
- Ideal for storing **unstructured data** such as images, videos, backups, logs, etc.
- It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- Supports virtually unlimited storage with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

### üìÇ Core Concepts
1. Buckets
- A bucket is a container for storing objects (files).
- You must create a bucket before storing data.
- Bucket names must be globally unique.
- Each AWS account can create up to 100 buckets by default.

2. Objects
- The basic unit of data stored in S3.
- Each object consists of:
  - Key (name)
  - Value (data)
  - Metadata
  - Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
  - Access control information

3. Keys
- A unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
- Acts like a file path (`folder1/file.txt`).

### üîê Security & Access Control
1. IAM Policies
- Controls who can access S3 at the user or group level.

2. Bucket Policies
- JSON-based policies to control access to entire buckets.

3. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- A legacy method of controlling access at object or bucket level.

4. S3 Block Public Access
- A feature that helps prevent accidental public exposure of data.

5. Encryption
- Server-side encryption (SSE):
  - SSE-S3 (S3 managed keys)
  - SSE-KMS (AWS KMS managed keys)
  - SSE-C (Customer-provided keys)
- Client-side encryption: Encrypt data before uploading.

### üìà Storage Classes
S3 provides multiple storage classes optimized for different use cases:

#### üí° 1. S3 Standard
- Use case: Frequently accessed data
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9's)
- Availability: 99.99%
- Features: Low latency, high throughput
- Example: Websites, mobile apps, data analytics

#### üßä 2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Use case: Data with unpredictable access patterns
- Durability: 99.999999999%
- Availability: 99.9%
- Features: Automatically moves data between access tiers (frequent, infrequent, archive)
- Example: Data lakes, long-term projects

#### ‚ùÑÔ∏è 3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
- Use case: Infrequently accessed data, but still needs quick access
- Durability: 99.999999999%
- Availability: 99.9%
- Retrieval time: Milliseconds
- Example: Backups, disaster recovery

#### üßä 4. S3 One Zone-IA

#### üïì 6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly just Glacier)
- Use case: Archive data that doesn't need to be retrieved quickly
- Retrieval options: Minutes to hours
- Cost: Lower than Glacier Instant
- Example: Compliance archives, historical data

#### üßä‚ùÑÔ∏è 7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Use case: Long-term, rarely accessed data (lowest cost)
- Retrieval time: 12 hours or less
- Durability: 99.999999999%
- Example: Legal records, long-term backups

### üîÅ Versioning
- Allows you to store multiple versions of an object.
- Protects against accidental deletions/overwrites.
- Enable at bucket level, cannot be undone (only suspended).

### ‚è≥ Lifecycle Management
- Automate the transition of objects between storage classes.
- Configure expiration policies to delete old objects.
- Defined via Lifecycle Configuration Rules.

### üåê Data Access
1. S3 URLs
- Can access objects via:
  - REST API: `https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/key`
  - Static website endpoint (if enabled)
2. Presigned URLs
- Temporary URLs to grant access to objects.
- Used for secure downloads/uploads.
3. S3 Select
- Retrieve subset of data (e.g., select rows/columns from CSV or JSON).
- Saves bandwidth and speeds up queries.

### üß© Integration & Features
- Static Website Hosting: Serve static content like HTML/CSS/JS.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Allow access from other domains.
- Event Notifications: Trigger Lambda, SNS, or SQS on object events (e.g., upload, delete).
- Replication: Automatically replicate data to another bucket (same or different region).
  - CRR ‚Äì Cross-Region Replication
  - SRR ‚Äì Same-Region Replication
- Multipart Uploads: Efficiently upload large objects by splitting them.

### üîê Encryption in S3
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) encryption is a way to protect data at rest and in transit. When enabled, data is automatically encrypted when written to disk and decrypted when accessed, without affecting application performance.

1. Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
Encryption is handled by AWS after S3 receives the data and before storing it on disk.

|Type    	 |Description	                                             |Key Management                                                                |
|SSE-S3	     |S3 manages the keys using Amazon S3-managed keys.	         |Fully managed by AWS (uses AES-256).                                          |
|SSE-KMS	 |Uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for key management.	 |Customer-managed or AWS-managed keys via KMS. Allows audit and access control.|
|SSE-C	     |Customer provides their own encryption keys.	             |You manage your own keys; AWS uses them temporarily to encrypt/decrypt data.  |

2. Client-Side Encryption (CSE)
With CSE, the client encrypts data before uploading to S3.

|Type	      |Description	                                                             |Key Management                                    |
|CSE-KMS	  |AWS SDK uses KMS to generate data keys for encryption before uploading.   |Managed via KMS.                                  |
|CSE-Custom	  |You use your own encryption libraries (e.g., envelope encryption).	     |Fully customer-managed keys and encryption logic. |

3. Encryption in Transit (In-Flight Encryption)
- Data is encrypted while it's moving from one place to another (e.g., from client to S3, or between AWS services).
- TLS/SSL (HTTPS): Default and strongly recommended for all S3 communications. Encrypts data in transit between clients and S3 or between AWS services.
- Client libraries (e.g., SDKs): Use HTTPS by default.
- VPC endpoints: You can use private connectivity (AWS PrivateLink) to further secure communication.

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- S3 Access Logs: Log requests made to the bucket.
- AWS CloudTrail: Logs API calls made to S3.
- AWS CloudWatch: Monitors S3 metrics (e.g., number of requests, latency).

### üßÆ Pricing
- Based on:
  - Storage used (per GB/month)
  - Data transfer out
  - PUT, GET, DELETE (Delete marker) operations
  - Storage class
- Free tier: 5 GB/month storage, 20,000 GET and 2,000 PUT requests.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Enable versioning + MFA delete for critical data.
- Use lifecycle policies to manage cost.
- Monitor public access and audit permissions regularly.
- Use presigned URLs for secure temporary access.
- Choose appropriate storage class for cost optimization.

### üìö Common Use Cases
- Backup and restore
- Big data analytics
- Static website hosting
- Application data storage
- Log storage and archiving
- Media hosting (images, videos)
