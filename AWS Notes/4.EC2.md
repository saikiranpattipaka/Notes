# EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

- Key Highlights:
  - Virtual servers in the cloud
  - Complete control over compute resources
  - Highly scalable and elastic
  - Integrated with other AWS services

- Benefits
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing
  - Scalability and elasticity
  - Fully managed infrastructure
  - Flexible instance types and OS choices

### Core Concepts of EC2
##### EC2 Instance
A virtual machine running on physical hardware in AWS data centers.

##### AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
A template that contains:
- Operating System
- Application server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- Applications and configuration

✅ Custom AMI: Can be created from a running instance to save configurations.

### Instance Type
Defines the hardware of the host computer used for the instance.

Families:
- T-series: Burstable (e.g., t4g)
- M-series: General purpose
- C-series: Compute optimized
- R/X-series: Memory optimized
- I-series: Storage optimized
- P/G-series: Accelerated computing (GPU/ML)

### EC2 Instance Lifecycle
##### States:
- Pending: Instance is launching
- Running: Instance is active
- Stopping/Stopped: Shut down but retains data (EBS-backed)
- Terminated: Deleted completely

### Key Pairs & SSH Access
##### Key Pair
- Consists of a public and private key.
- AWS stores the public key; you keep the private key (*.pem).
- Used for SSH access to Linux instances.

##### Connecting via SSH
```
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
```

### Networking in EC2
##### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Logical isolation of your AWS resources.
- EC2 instances must be launched in a VPC.

##### Subnets
- Segments within a VPC.
- Can be public (internet-facing) or private.

##### Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Allows internet access to public subnets.

##### NAT Gateway
Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet.

### Security in EC2
##### Security Groups
- Instance-level firewalls
- Allow specific inbound and outbound traffic
- Stateful: return traffic is automatically allowed

##### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- Operate at the subnet level
- Stateless: explicit rules for both directions
- Good for layer of security in DMZ or multitenant apps

##### IAM Roles for EC2
- Attach IAM roles to grant EC2 instances permission to call other AWS services without using access keys.

### Storage Options
##### EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- Persistent block storage for EC2.
- Attached to instances as volumes.

  - gp3 -	General SSD
  - io2	-   High-performance SSD
  - st1 -	Throughput HDD
  - sc1	-   Cold storage HDD

✅ Snapshots: Back up volumes; stored in S3.

##### Instance Store
- Temporary storage tied to the instance lifecycle.
- Data lost on stop/terminate.

##### EFS (Elastic File System)
- Scalable, shared file system.
- Accessible from multiple instances via NFS.

##### FSx
- Managed file system (Windows, Lustre, NetApp ONTAP)

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting
##### EC2 Status Checks
- System Status Check: Underlying AWS issues
- Instance Status Check: OS-level issues

##### CloudWatch
- Monitor metrics like CPU, network, disk
- Configure Alarms for automation

##### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
- Run commands on instances
- No need for SSH access
- Patch management and automation

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
##### Types:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB): Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB): Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): For security appliances

##### Integration:
- Place instances in a Target Group
- Attach the group to a load balancer
- Use health checks to route traffic only to healthy instances

### Auto Scaling
##### Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances
- Ensures application availability and cost-efficiency

##### Scaling Policies:
- Manual
- Scheduled (based on time)
- Dynamic (based on CloudWatch metrics)

### EC2 Pricing Models
|Model	              |Description	                 |Best Use             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
|On-Demand	          |Pay by hour/second	           |Short workloads      |
|Reserved Instances	  |Commit 1 or 3 years	         |Long-term apps       |
|Spot Instances	      |Bid-based, interruptible	     |Batch jobs           |
|Savings Plans	      |Flexible pricing commitment	 |General purpose      |
|Dedicated Hosts	    |Physical isolation	           |Licensing/compliance |

###  EC2 Best Practices
- Use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials.
- Monitor instances with CloudWatch.
- Regularly back up volumes with snapshots.
- Use Auto Scaling to handle load.
- Harden instances (disable root login, use strong security groups).
- Patch systems regularly via SSM Patch Manager.
- Tag resources for cost and operational management.
